# mcio_remote
A Python interface for connecting to [MCio](https://github.com/twoturtles/MCio), a Minecraft mod enabling AI agent development.

## Overview
[MCio](https://github.com/twoturtles/MCio) is a Fabric mod that creates a network interface to Minecraft. It enables programmatic control through simulated keyboard/mouse inputs while providing video frame output and state information. The mod is designed primarily for AI researchers developing agents in the Minecraft environment.

MCio can be installed directly from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/TwoTurtles) without requiring a Java build.

This Python package (mcio_remote) provides the interface for connecting to MCio, including a [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) environment for reinforcement learning.
